# smugline [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gingerlime/smugline.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gingerlime/smugline)

a simple command line tool for smugmug (using [smugpy](https://github.com/chrishoffman/smugpy)).
Written in python 2.x/3.x

## Important Note:

Currently broken. Unfortunately [smugpy](https://github.com/chrishoffman/smugpy) looks abandoned, and since June 11, 2018, SmugMug API only accepts SSL connections (which smugpy doesn't support). Any volunteers to fork or upgrade smugpy or build the API v2 binding (or to take over the project), please get in touch.

## Installation

* `git clone` the repository from github
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## API Key

You must have a smugmug account and [apply for an API key](http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys).
Once you apply, the API key will be visible on your account settings -> Me -> API keys.
You only need the `Key` (no need for the `Secret`).

## Features

* listing albums on your smugmug account
* uploading from a folder (recursively) to an album on smugmug
* downloading from an album on smugmug to a local folder
* existing images will be uploaded only once (skipping duplicates)
* uploading images, videos or both (default: images)
* clearing duplicate images or video from an album

## Duplicates

smugline tries to avoid uploading images that were already uploaded to smugmug. To do so, it relies on the MD5 signature, based on the actual content of the image. This is the most reliable way to detect two identical copies of any file. However, Smugmug appears to auto-rotate images once they are uploaded. In such cases, the MD5 signature will mismatch and duplicate images might still get created.

A workaround for this problem, is to rotate all images *before* uploading. [More information about image rotation tools](http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_auto-rotate_digital_photos_to_their_proper_orientation).

On Linux, the best way to achieve this is using the `exifautotran` utility (on ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install libjpeg-turbo-progs`).

### Clearing duplicates

the `clear_duplicates` command will search for items in an album with identical MD5 signature, and will keep only one
copy. It won't detect any changes to metadata (caption, comments etc), so use with care!
